# orlab

**orlab** is a Python module designed to simplify interaction and scripting with [OpenRocket](https://openrocket.info/) from Python. It leverages JPype to bridge Python and Java, enabling seamless control over OpenRocket's functionalities. Currently, it supports access to simulation capabilities given an `.ork` file, with the goal of future expansion to enable more sophisticated computational engineering workflows.

This project is an evolution of the original [orlab](https://github.com/SilentSys/orlab) library, which hasn't been maintained recently. **orlab** updates the compatibility with OpenRocket 23.09, reorganizes the code for better structure, and plans to incorporate additional features.

## Prerequisites

Before installing **orlab**, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **OpenRocket** version **23.09**
  - [Download OpenRocket](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/releases/download/release-23.09/OpenRocket-23.09.jar)
- **Adoptium JDK 21 LTS** or higher
  - [Download Adoptium JDK](https://adoptium.net/)
- **Python** version **3.6** or higher

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   $$$bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/orlab.git
   cd orlab
   $$$

2. **Install the Package**

   Install **orlab** using `pip`:

   $$$bash
   pip install .
   $$$

   *For development purposes, you can install in editable mode:*

   $$$bash
   pip install -e .
   $$$

3. **Download OpenRocket JAR**

   If you haven't already, download the OpenRocket `.jar` file:

   - **Direct Download:** [OpenRocket-23.09.jar](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/releases/download/release-23.09/OpenRocket-23.09.jar)

   - **Using `wget` on Linux:**

     $$$bash
     wget https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/releases/download/release-23.09/OpenRocket-23.09.jar
     $$$

4. **Set the `CLASSPATH` Environment Variable**

   Ensure that the `CLASSPATH` includes the path to the OpenRocket `.jar` file. This step is only necessary if the `.jar` file is not located in the current directory.

   $$$bash
   export CLASSPATH=/path/to/OpenRocket-23.09.jar
   $$$

   *Replace `/path/to/` with the actual directory path where the `.jar` file is located.*

## Setting Up the JDK

### Linux

1. **Install Adoptium JDK 21 LTS**

   Download and install the Adoptium JDK from the [official website](https://adoptium.net/).

2. **Set the `JAVA_HOME` Environment Variable**

   If JPype doesn't automatically detect the JDK, manually set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:

   - **Find Installation Directory:**

     Locate where Adoptium JDK is installed, e.g., `/usr/lib/jvm/adoptium-21`.

   - **Edit `~/.bashrc`:**

     Open the `.bashrc` file with your preferred text editor:

     $$$bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     $$$

   - **Add the Following Line:**

     $$$bash
     export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/adoptium-21"
     $$$

   - **Apply Changes:**

     $$$bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     $$$

### Windows

1. **Install Adoptium JDK 21 LTS**

   Download and install the Adoptium JDK from the [official website](https://adoptium.net/).

2. **Set Environment Variables**

   - **Open Environment Variables Settings:**

     Navigate to `Control Panel` > `System` > `Advanced system settings` > `Environment Variables`.

   - **Add `JAVA_HOME`:**

     - Click on `New` under **System variables**.
     - Set **Variable name** to `JAVA_HOME`.
     - Set **Variable value** to the path where Adoptium JDK is installed, e.g., `C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21`.

   - **Update `PATH`:**

     - Select the `Path` variable and click `Edit`.
     - Click `New` and add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`.

   - **Apply and Close:**

     Click `OK` to apply the changes.

## Usage

After installation and setup, you can start using **orlab** to interact with OpenRocket. Refer to the `examples/` directory for sample scripts demonstrating various functionalities.

For more detailed information and advanced usage, consult the [OpenRocket Wiki on Scripting with Python and JPype](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/wiki/Scripting-with-Python-and-JPype).

## Development

If you wish to contribute or modify **orlab**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
